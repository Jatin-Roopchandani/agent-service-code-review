## Overview
Build an agent (the 'code review' agent) that automates the process of reviewing a GitHub pull request by clustering diffs, reviewing each cluster, filtering reviews, and posting a summary comment on the PR.

**Note:** Bash tools and grep tools are already provided and available for use. For each step, use only the tools that are actually needed for that stepâ€”do not declare or pass extra tools that are not required. (For example, only pass `gh` to steps that fetch PR data, and grep tools to steps that analyze code.)

## Agent Structure Requirements
- Implement a single custom agent class (subclass of BaseAgent) that orchestrates the entire workflow.
- Inside this agent, each major step must be implemented as a separate LlmAgent instance:
  - Fetch and cluster PR diffs: LlmAgent with output_key="base_clusters" and only the tools needed for fetching (e.g., `gh`).
  - Review each diff cluster: LlmAgent with output_key="review" and only the tools needed for code review (e.g., grep tools).
  - Filter reviews: LlmAgent with output_key="reviewed_review" (no tools needed, just LLM filtering).
  - Post summary comment: LlmAgent with output_key="output" and only the tools needed for posting (e.g., `gh`).
- The workflow agent should run each LlmAgent in sequence, yielding events and checking for required state after each step, as in the resolve issue agent. Use an iterative, step-by-step approach, but only use iterations/loops where necessary (e.g., for reviewing each cluster).
- The main agent should yield events from each sub-agent and handle errors (e.g., check for required state after each step, yield error events if missing).
- Place all agent logic and workflow orchestration in `agent.py`.
- `main.py` should only contain a minimal entrypoint to run the agent (argument parsing, session initialization, running the agent). Do NOT put agent logic in main.py.

## User Workflow

### Input Requirements
The user provides:
- **PR URL**: A link to the GitHub pull request to be reviewed.

### Output Requirements
Return a JSON response containing:
- **Clusters** - The clustered diffs for the PR, with descriptions and file diffs.
- **Reviews** - The code review for each cluster, filtered for actionable feedback.
- **Summary** - The final comment posted to the PR.
- **Success** - Boolean indicating if the process completed successfully.
- **Error** - Error message if any step fails.

## Features

### Step 1: Fetch and Cluster PR Diffs
- Retrieve the diffs and metadata for the PR using the GitHub CLI (via the provided bash tools).
- Cluster the diffs into logical groups using the LLM.
- Implement this as a dedicated LlmAgent instance with output_key="base_clusters" 
- Clean up the diffs by removing any unnecessary escape characters (like \\\\' for single quotes)
- Structure the clusters into a well-defined JSON schema for downstream processing.

### Step 2: Review Each Diff Cluster
- For each cluster, review the code diffs using the LLM and grep tools as needed.
- Implement this as a dedicated LlmAgent instance with output_key="review"
- Iterate over all clusters, yielding events and collecting reviews.
- The output must include the affected code snippet, the start line and end line of the snippet and the details of the review

### Step 3: Filter Reviews
- Filter the reviews to remove non-actionable or non-useful feedback using the LLM.
- Implement this as a dedicated LlmAgent instance with output_key="reviewed_review".
- Output a review in the form of a string.

### Step 4: Post Summary Comment
- Collate the filtered reviews into a single markdown comment and post it to the PR using the GitHub CLI.
- Implement this as a dedicated LlmAgent instance with output_key="output".
- The esponse should be a single bash command only that posts the formatted comment to the PR.

## Error Handling
- The agent must validate the presence and format of the PR URL before proceeding. If the PR URL is missing or invalid, return a JSON response with `success: false` and `error: "No pr_url provided"` or `error: "Invalid pr_url format"`.
- If fetching or clustering diffs fails, return `success: false` and `error: "No base_clusters found"`.
- If structuring output fails, return `success: false` and `error: "No clusters found"`.
- If reviewing a cluster fails, return `success: false` and `error: "Review failed for cluster X"`.
- If filtering reviews fails, return `success: false` and `error: "Review filtering failed"`.
- If posting the summary comment fails, return `success: false` and `error: "Comment posting failed"`.
- For any other error, return a clear, specific error message in the `error` field and set `success: false`.
- In all error cases, fields that are not available due to the error (e.g., `clusters`, `reviews`, `summary`) should be null or omitted.


## Response Format
- Apply to `agent.py`

## Agent Behavior
- Accept requests with a PR URL.
- Validate input before proceeding.
- Return structured JSON responses.
- Include helpful error messages for invalid or failed steps.
- Use only the provided bash and grep tools for all codebase operations, and only the tools needed for each step.

## Environment Variables
- Requires access to GitHub CLI and repository.
- No external API keys required beyond GitHub authentication.

## Dependencies
- **Python** (for agent logic)
- **Bash tools**: `gh`, `git`
- **Grep tools** (for code analysis)
- **JSON** for response formatting
